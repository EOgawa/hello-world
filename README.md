# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

I'm Evan Ogawa, this is my second year at foothill college, and my second class in computer science, but my first time using github, or taking an online class.

In my mid-late teens, I taught myself a little objective c, just enough to mak an iOS program where you could move a dot around on a checkerboard, but forgot everything I leaned since then.

Now that I'm in my mid twenties, I've decided I want to become a professional software engineer, so I'm taking these classes to properly learn how to do programming for that.
